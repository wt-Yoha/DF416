+ ## 什么是机器学习

目前包括了两种定义

>***Arthur Samuel*** described it as: "the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed." This is an older, informal definition.

>***Tom Mitchell*** provides a more modern definition: "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E."



+ ## 监督学习（Supervised Learning）

　　In supervised learning, we are given a data set and already know what our correct output
should look like, having the idea that there is a relationship between the input and the output.Supervised learning problems are categorized into **"regression"** and **"classification"** problems. 

　　In a **regression** problem, we are trying to predict results within a <u>continuous output</u>, meaning that we are trying to map input variables to some continuous function. In a **classification**
problem, we are instead trying to predict results in a <u>discrete output.</u> 



+ ## 无监督学习（Unsupervised learning ）

　　Unsupervised learning allows us to approach problems with little or no idea what our results
should look like. We can derive structure from data where we don't necessarily know the
effect of the variables.
　　We can derive this structure by clustering the data based on relationships among the variables in the data.
　　With unsupervised learning there is no feedback based on the prediction results.
